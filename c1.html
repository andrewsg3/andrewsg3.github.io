        <p>Boglin slipped a hokey cokey finger into his gum crack. <i>Oh happy day, I can't wait to be feeling high on cocaine!</i> Across from him, a drip fell from McLaughlin's nose and onto the table. </p>
        <p><i>\-----\The lifecycle of a butterfly is in four stages: egg, caterpillar, pupa and adult butterfly.\-----\</i></p>
        <p>More nonsense from the radio. Boglin was a ticket inspector on the trams, though the yellow callouses on his hands led many to believe he was a prostitute on their first meeting. This could equally be attributed to the fact that he enjoyed roleplaying as a prostitue - going out late at night, having sex with tricks under West Bridge, taking their money and kissing them goodbye. He was the best roleplay prostitute in town. McLaughlin was an English teacher at a pretty middle of the road school, atleast, pretty middle of the road for where they stayed, which could be pretty different from pretty middle of the road where you or anyone else stay, thanks very much, cunt. They had once been soldiers together in a mind war against the forces of darkness. Today they were playing chess.</p>
