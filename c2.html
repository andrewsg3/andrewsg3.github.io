        <p>McLaughlin began coughing a deep, phlegmy cough as he closed the door. It had begun a few weeks ago and its gradual descent through his body showed no signs of slowing. He unzipped his fly and drained about a pint of yellow piss onto his welcome mat. He shook three times. It wasn’t completely dry. He was preparing to conceal his meager peanus when he heard a soft plastic click. An explosion of pain erupted at the end of his unit. </p>
        <p><i>FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! OW! FUCK!</i></p>
        <p>After a few twisting minutes of agony, the throbbing red pulses in his head began to subside. McLaughlin’s attention turned to the nearby sound of laughter. </p>
        <p><i>Stupid cunt! hahahahaha!</i></p>
        <p>Three kids from down the hall were creasing themselves, crying with laughter at him, absolutely pissing themselves, rolling on the floor laughing my ass off (ROFLMAOing). The one on the left, the tallest of them, wore a tattered black evening suit. The middle child paired an oversized hoodie against running shorts and flip flops. He was twirling a lollipop in his mouth in an annoyingly cool fashion, also wearing sunglasses and he had some festival wristbands that had been there a while. The rightmost kid was leaning against the wall in a chewbacca dressing gown. I change my mind about the middle kid, he had a taekwondo suit on, think they call it a Gi. Actually scratch that, I’ll save that for later when we meet their king. The chewbacca child held an undersized BB rifle in his hands, still dribbling smoke.</p>
        <p><i>You just got inverted you old prick!</i></p>
        <p>These bastard kids had never had the guts to point a gun at him before. McLaughlin calmed himself.</p>
        <p><i>What did you do that for, you little bastard kids? </i></p>
        <p><i>What kind of freak pisses on their own door?</i>, came the reply.</p>
        <p>McLaughlin flew into a rage.</p>
        <p><i>YOU SWEET INNOCENT LITTLE BOYS ! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT I’VE SEEN ! YOU DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH WE SACRIFICED FOR YOU !</i></p>
        <p>His resonant frequency was becoming visibly more erratic and noisy.</p>
        <p><i>I USED TO HOLD A GUN LIKE THAT; A MENTAL GUN. I SLEPT WITH IT UNDER MY PILLOW IN THE FIELD. I HUNTED ECHOES OF OUR PAST ON THE HYPNAGOGIC PLANE, IMPRINTS OF OUR SHARED SOMATIC HERITAGE - </i></p>
        <p>The child shot him again, this time in the neck. He clasped at stinging skin and inspected his hand. He had half expected to see blood. A yellow pellet sat at his feet. </p>
        <p><i>Gamli maðurinn er greinilega sár, við ættum að hætta leik okkar. Við erum betri en þetta.</i>The middle kid with the hoodie said this. </p>
        <p><i>Is that scandinavian or something? The letters look scandinavian or something</i>, said the child in the evening suit. McLaughlin thought it was odd that the child would be surprised his friend was speaking some kind of scandinavian language; surely they had known each other for longer than he’d been in the hallway with them? The letters did look Scandinavian…</p>
        <p>Chewbacca drained a capri sun and threw it on the ground. <i>Fat neck, you’re crying.</i></p>
        <p>McLaughlin hadn’t noticed he was crying.</p>
        <p><i>But I’m the ungerdod, the dundergod, underdog- the handsome hero guy who overcomes his hideous form to win the girl and always be cooler than sidekick - </i></p>
        <p>He began to chase the children. They shot up the stairs and out of his view. He was in hot pursuit. The stairs had a hole bit in the middle that he could look up and they sometimes looked down and would see each other and giggle a bit then keep going. They all giggled together when they saw each other looking up and down the hole bit and it was a nice intermission from the stress of the situation. <i>I’ll kill those fucking kids,</i> thought McLaughlin. <i>In Minecraft.</i></p>
